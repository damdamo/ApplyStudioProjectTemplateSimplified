# Apply Studio Project Template Simplified

This plug-in is a customised version of the original [Apply Studio Project Template](https://github.com/RWS/Sdl-Community/tree/master/ApplyStudioProjectTemplate) plug-in.

The functionality is almost identical to the original, with the key difference being that it comes pre-configured and cannot be changed. Settings can be viewed but not modified by the user. In contrast, the original version allows users full control over all settings.

As the name suggests, this plug-in merges two templates: one from the current project and another that the user can select. It also provides the option to apply the changes to the "active/current" project or a list of pre-selected projects (to be chosen before opening the plug-in).

## Original text

This plug-in allows you to apply settings from a template (.sdltpl) or project (.sdlproj) to one or more projects in SDL Trados Studio. The following settings can be applied:
- Translation Memory and Automated Translation*
- Translation Memory
- Terminology*
- Batch Processing
- Verification
- File Types

*it's possible to merge the lists of translation and terminology providers

The settings can be applied to either the active project or all selected projects in the projects view.

Once installed, you will now be able to see the option to Apply Studio Project Template by right clicking on a project in the Projects view. You can also open the Plugin in Studio by pressing Ctrl + Alt + T.
